# Discord-JS-Cleverbot-Example
Description: "Using Cleverbot API (https://www.cleverbot.com/api/) to make a discord bot that responds to mentions using Discord-JS!"



Check the node JS file node.js for an example of how you can use the API to get your discord bot able to respond to mentions as a human I guess.


--> Known bugs:
 - Spams users when you PM the bot and waste all free API requests from https://www.cleverbot.com/api/ (check how to)!
 - (FIXED, https://github.com/Stijny/Discord-JS-Cleverbot-Example/issues/1) This isn't really a bug, but you HAVE to mention the bot at first, looking for a way to just make it like if it has @BOTNAME#0001 in the message. Or make it toggleable. As said not really a bug but a thing we'll have to work on.
 - This is just not nice, the user can spam the bot and get you out of API requests. Adding cooldown soon as possible.
 
 
 
 
 --> How to:
 
 * For Linux:
   - Open SSH and an FTP program. 
   - Then install the node.js file make sure you have installed NPM & Node-JS. 
   - Then do `npm install discord.js` then wait for it to install. After that do `npm install cleverbot-node` wait for it.
   - Now you need an API key from https://www.cleverbot.com/api/ in order to do that create an account on that sit. Then copy your 'API key' then put it in the node.js file. It is limited to an x amount of request when you're out of API requests you can buy them or create a new account but that won't support the developers that's up to you.
   
 * For Windows: 
    - SOON!
