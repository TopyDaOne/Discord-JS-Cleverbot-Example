# Discord-JS-Cleverbot-Example
Description: "Using Cleverbot API (https://www.cleverbot.com/api/) to make a discord bot that responds on mentions using Discord-JS!"

#NOTE: ADDING THE FILE SOON, FOUND A LITTLE ISSUE FIXING. I'LL ADD BACK AFTER. JUST KEEP AN EYE ON THIS.



Check the node JS file node.js for an example of how you can use the API to get your discord bot able to respond on mentions as a human I guess.


--> Known bugs:
 - Spams users when you PM the bot and waste all free API requests from https://www.cleverbot.com/api/ (check how to)!
 - This isn't really a bug, but you HAVE to mention the bot at first, looking in a way to just make it like if it has @BOTNAME#0001 in the message. Or make it toggleabble. As said not really a bug but a thing we'll have to work on.
 - This is just not nice, the user can spam the bot and get you out off API requests. Adding cooldown soon as possible.
 
 
 
 
 --> How to:
 
 * For linux:
   - Open SSH and a FTP program. 
   - Then install the node.js file make sure you have instaled NPM & Node-JS. 
   - Then do `npm install discord.js` then wait for it to install. After that do `npm install cleverbot-node` wait for it.
   - Now you need an API key from https://www.cleverbot.com/api/ in order to do that create an account on that sit. Then copy your 'API key' then put it in the node.js file. It is limited to a x amount of request when you're out of API requests you can buy them or create a new account but that won't support the developers that's up to you.
   
 * For Windows: 
    - SOON!
